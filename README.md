## how does this application work
+ The application itself, or rather the scanner in it, will be based on AI. The AI will first be loaded with many pictures describing certain conditions for the occurrence of a particular disease in crops.
+ To use the application you simply need to bring the scanner to the diseased plant. The scanner will immediately provide complete information about what ails the crop and what methods to treat it.
+ The application will also show popular partner garden stores and their assortment. So after scanning, you can immediately order the devices you need.

## What the user needs to do?
+ All you need to do is register
##Why is registration necessary?
+ This will allow you to communicate with other app users through the built-in chat.
+ This will allow the application to save scan history.
+ This will allow you to order products from agricultural stores to your home.
## In conclusion, I want to say that this application will allow humanity to step forward, albeit not 1000 years into the future, but definitely a couple of years.
